This project is about prediction of a strategy on promotions. On the dataset  , promotion column  values are strings: Yes and No. Problem is  to have a strategy based on the data for a better  company performance. I used XGBoost. Yes an No I converted onto numbers 1 and 0  , then after predictions are done I converted back 1 and 0 into Yes and No.
